## How to Redux
- npm install redux react-redux redux-thunk
- thunk is for async
- combine reducers is to create single root reducer instead of having multiple stores (see api doc)

- Get redux devtools

- create reduxtypes
- create /Actions and mock data / mock api
- create /Reducers
- create store - middleware, thunk, async(to use redux in componentDidMount), compose

- create TestComponent to connect to redux

- Add this.props.fetchBrokers() in componentDidMount in TestComponent
